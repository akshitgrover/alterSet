## My favorite function of 'alterSet'

All alterSet functions be it protoypes or standalone are written to make life easier with JS Objects, Only a few are implemented and more will be added soon.

Coming to my favorite it's just that a lot of thought has been put up to implement each function and all of the are favorites in some way or the other.

To choose one, I'll go for `AlterSet.protoype.withValue(value)`, this function returns array of keys which hash to a specified value, This can be very handy when you need mappings in both ways.

## Grow AlterSet

To make this library more and more useful it is necessary to add more intuitive and useful functions to it, If you stumble across any idea of a function which can prove to be handy, go ahead open an issue and create a PR.
